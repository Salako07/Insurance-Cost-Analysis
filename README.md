# Insurance Cost Prediction Project

## Project Overview  
This project aims to predict insurance costs based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building machine learning models for accurate cost prediction.  

## Objectives  
- Perform detailed EDA to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.  
- Visualize key features and their influence on insurance charges.  
- Build predictive models to estimate insurance costs.  

## Roles and Responsibilities  
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Emmanuel Salako**: Conducted EDA to identify trends and insights within the dataset.  
  - Explored relationships between independent variables (e.g., age, BMI, region) and the target variable (charges).  
  - Visualized data distributions and correlations using tools like Seaborn and Plotly.  
  - Provided actionable insights for the machine learning team to enhance model performance.

## Dataset  
The dataset includes the following columns:  
- **Age**: Age of the policyholder  
- **Sex**: Gender of the policyholder  
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat  
- **Children**: Number of dependents  
- **Smoker**: Whether the policyholder is a smoker  
- **Region**: Residential region of the policyholder  
- **Charges**: Medical insurance cost billed by the insurance provider  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  

## Key Insights from EDA  
- Smokers have significantly higher insurance charges compared to non-smokers.  
- BMI positively correlates with insurance costs, especially for individuals classified as obese.  
- The number of children and region show minimal impact on insurance costs.
